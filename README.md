Tarp (v0.1.2)
======

Overview
--------

*Tarp* is an *almost* single header C library to raster vector graphics. It provides a lightweight and portable API purely focussed on decently fast rendering without any gimmicks.

What can Tarp do?
--------
- Rasterize fills and strokes.
- Stroke joins (round, bevel, miter) and caps (round, square, butt).
- Dashed strokes.
- Gradients (linear and radial) as fill and strokes.
- Transformations for path, fills and strokes.
- EvenOdd and NonZero fill rules.
- Nested path clipping.
- Non-scaling stroke.

What does Tarp not want to provide?
--------
- A matrix stack.
- Any form of document representation.
- Any form of document loading. (SVG etc.)
- Bezier math that goes beyond rendering.
- Raster image rendering
- Text rendering. (Dealing with fonts is a huge task by itself, you can easily build a font rasterizer on top of Tarp using *stb_truetype* or *freeimage*, though)

Basic usage
--------

Install *Tarp* or add the Tarp folder to your source directory. Include it into your project with `#include <Tarp/Tarp.h>`. Specify the implementation you want to compile in **one** c/c++ file to create the implementation, i.e.:

```
/* include OpenGL here! */

/* tell Tarp to compile the opengl implementations */
#define TARP_IMPLEMENTATION_OPENGL
#include <Tarp/Tarp.h>
```

Here is a basic *Tarp* example:

```
tpContext ctx;
tpPath path;
tpStyle style;
tpMat4 proj;

/* initialize the tarp context */
ctx = tpContextCreate();
if (!tpContextIsValidHandle(ctx))
{
    printf("Could not init Tarp context: %s\n", tpContextErrorMessage(ctx));
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

/* set an orthographic projection based on the window size */
proj = tpMat4MakeOrtho(0, wwidth, wheight, 0, -1, 1);
tpSetProjection(ctx, &proj);

/* create a path and add one circle contour */
path = tpPathCreate();
tpPathAddCircle(path, 400, 300, 100);

/* add another custom contour to the path */
tpPathMoveTo(path, 400, 320);
tpPathLineTo(path, 420, 280);
tpPathQuadraticCurveTo(path, 400, 260, 380, 280);
tpPathClose(path); /* close the contour */

/* create a style that we can draw the path with */
style = tpStyleMake();
style.fill = tpPaintMakeColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
style.stroke = tpPaintMakeColor(1.0f, 0.6f, 0.1f, 1.0f);
style.strokeWidth = 10.0;
style.strokeJoin = kTpStrokeJoinRound;

/* ... */

/* call this at the beginning of your frame */
tpPrepareDrawing(ctx);

/* draw the path with our style */
tpDrawPath(ctx, path, &style);

/* call this when you are done with Tarp for the frame */
tpFinishDrawing(ctx);

/* ... */

/* clean up tarp */
tpPathDestroy(path);
tpContextDestroy(ctx);
```
Check out *HelloWorld.c* in the examples folder for the full source of this example using *OpenGL* and *GLFW*.

Building the examples
--------
You need *CMake* to build the examples.
```
cd Tarp
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
```

Installing Tarp
--------
If you use Tarp a lot and you'd prefer to have it installed, you can do so using `make install`. You'll need cmake to do so.

TODO
--------
- Possibly an OpenGL ES based backend?
- Try out NV_path_rendering on linux as a backend?

How does Tarp rasterize
--------
The only available backend right now is one written in *OpenGL*. It is based on the *stencil and cover* method.

Supported Platforms
-------------

Any platform that supports OpenGL 3.0+. Tested on *OSX*, *Linux* and *Windows* so far.
